# Fashion MNIST Classifier

This project demonstrates a deep learning model that classifies images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. It includes a fully-trained neural network for classifying images of clothing into 10 categories such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.

## Features
- Preprocessing of Fashion MNIST dataset
- Neural network model using regularization (L2) to improve generalization
- Image prediction functionality for user-uploaded images
- Output visualizations of predictions and class probabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

To run the project, clone this repository and install the necessary packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fashion-mnist-classifier.git
cd fashion-mnist-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
